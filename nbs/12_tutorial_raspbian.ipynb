It is recommended to get a Raspberry Pi 4 with as much RAM as possible, especially if you want to capture raw data. Otherwise, you will need to a `processing_lvl` that includes binning to reduce the datacube size. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Raspberry Pi does not have the same processing power as a typical laptop/computer and so expect the framerate to drop slightly. You want a lightweight operating system so the camera can run as fast as possible - this rules out the Ubuntu 64 bit OS. If you have 8 GB of RAM, definitely get the Raspbian 64 bit OS so you can use > 3 GB per process. Another benefit of running on ARM64 bit is that there are prebuilt OpenCV Python wheels - if your project requires `opencv-python`, then 64 bit is needed.\n",
